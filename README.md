This project on “Shop Interface System” is an interface system for the customer and the admin. This project is done in C++ and aims to create an environment to buy items and generate a bill and also to add/remove items from the purchase list. Initially, in the home screen you have an option to access the shop either as an admin or as a customer.
The customer can buy numerous items along with the quantity of items from the list of items stored in a file and can also provide a discount code to receive a discount. At the end, a bill for the purchases is generated and the bill is stored.
The admin section is password protected and can add and remove items from the existing list of items. The admin can also access and view all the existing bills that have been previously stored.
